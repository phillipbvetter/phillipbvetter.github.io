Stochatic Differential Equations using Template Model Builder

This is a package for parameter and state estimation and forecasting in stochastic state space systems, that is a system whose (latent) states evolve according to a system of stochastic differential equations that are (in)directly observed as specified by a series of noisy measurement equations.

```math
dx_{t} = f(t,x_{t},u_{t}) \, dt + g(t,x_{t},u_{t}) \, dB_{t}
```

```math
y(t_{k}) = h(x_{t_k}) + \varepsilon

```
