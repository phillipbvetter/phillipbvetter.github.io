## [Continuous Time Stochastic Modelling using Template Model Builder](https://phillipbvetter.github.io/ctsmTMB/)

*ctsmTMB* is an *R* package for parameter and state estimation and forecasting in stochastic state space systems. These are partially observed state space systems that whose latent states evolve according to a system of stochastic differential equation. The package employs the R6 object for easy model construction, and uses the TMB/RTMB packages for its modern C++ implementations and algorithmic differentiation. The estimation methods implemented are Kalman filters (Linear, Extended and Unscented) in addition to a smoothing method based on the Laplace approximation.
