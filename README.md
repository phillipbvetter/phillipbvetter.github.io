Welcome to my GitHub homepage. You can find some of my work below:

## [Stochatic Differential Equations using Template Model Builder](https://phillipbvetter.github.io/sdeTMB/)

*sdeTMB* is an *R* package for for parameter and state estimation and forecasting in stochastic state space systems. These are partially observed state space systems that whose latent states evolve according to a system of stochastic differential equation.
